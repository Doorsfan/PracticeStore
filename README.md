# PracticeStore

This is my second individual project in terms of Web Development - Where i wanted to construct a practice project in terms of a Pretend Shop.  In this project, i learned the basic usage of Cookies, sending Emails and a bit of Server management in terms of processing form data from Requests. There is no database integrated - as i did not deem it to be enough of relevance in the context quite yet. 

It is a Webserver hosted on Express.
